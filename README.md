# Zara-Strategic-Marketing-and-Agile-Supply-Chain

Approch employed to create the dashboard:
1. I loaded and combined data files using an append query in Transform Data. Then, I cleaned up the data in Power Query by removing unnecessary columns and disabling unwanted tables
2. Create3d new measures and columns in the POwer Query Editor to calculate intermediate and final Values.
3. Utilized bar graphs, line charts, slicers, drill-downs to create the dasboard and applied visual effects to give a look and feel of Zara website (Black and White Theme).
